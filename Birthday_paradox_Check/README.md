# Birthday Paradox Checker

* Birthday Paradox states for 23 candidates the probability that more than 1 candidate's birthday lies on the same day as any of the other candidates is approximately 50%
* For more info check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem
* Generates random number between 1 and 365/366 for each of 23 candidates (Set as N), 1000 times (Set as N_rounds). 
* (Note: Both 23 and 1000 values can be changed accordingly. This is just for proof)
* The purpose of code is to check that probability percentage of duplicate date comes close to 50%
